# Demo Folder

This folder is intended for storing demo photos, screenshots, and other visual assets that showcase the features and user interface of the Stock Scoring & Advisory System.

## How to Add Demo Photos

1. Take screenshots or save images that demonstrate the application's features (e.g., dashboard, analysis results, charts).
2. Save your images in this `demo` folder. Example filenames:
   - dashboard.png
   - analysis_example.png
   - news_sentiment.png
3. You can reference these images in the main `README.md` or in this file using Markdown:

```markdown
![Dashboard](demo/dashboard.png)
![Analysis Example](demo/analysis_example.png)
```

## Example

Below is an example of how to display images in Markdown (replace with your actual images):

![Sample Dashboard](demo/dashboard.png)
![Sample Analysis](demo/analysis_example.png)

**Tip:** Keep your demo images up to date as you improve your application!
